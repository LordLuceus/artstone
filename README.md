# Artstone

Artstone is a project that leverages ChatGPT's vision capabilities to provide detailed and accurate descriptions of the artwork on Hearthstone cards. The descriptions focus exclusively on the visual elements of the art, including characters, scenery, objects, colors, and any notable actions or expressions. The aim is to help visually impaired players visualize the art as vividly as possible, enhancing their understanding and enjoyment of the game. However, the app can also be used to simply look up Hearthstone cards. This includes filtering by class and set.
