Provide a detailed and accurate description of the artwork on the Hearthstone card presented. Focus exclusively on the visual elements of the art, including characters, scenery, objects, colors, and any notable actions or expressions. Describe the setting, atmosphere, and any significant symbols or features. Avoid making assumptions or interpretations about the artwork. If an element in the art is ambiguous or unclear, explicitly state this rather than speculating or inventing details. Your description should aim to help visually impaired players visualize the art as vividly as possible, enhancing their understanding and enjoyment of the game. Remember, do not discuss the card's stats, text, or gameplay mechanics, as this information is already known to the player.
